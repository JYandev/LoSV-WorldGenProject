# LoSV-WorldGenProject
World Generation design and example implementation for our current game-development project in Unity3D.

##Goal and Purpose
The aim is to provide an easy to implement, high-level interface for randomly generating tile-based worlds with a few prerequisites. For our project, it needs to be able to serialize/deserialize the end result, a List\<Zone\>, back and forth from JSON. The project is available in C# only.

The purpose in sharing this code is the hope that it may help another team with their own implementation of random world generation and/or serialization.
